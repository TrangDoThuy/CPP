1. If we have an array of object, delete[] will call the class destructor on each array element in reverse order:
the last element first till the first one.

2. the destructor of a static book is automatically called when it goes out of scope.

3. struct{...}=class{public:....}
  class{...}=struct{private:...} // default
  class Haha{
    int a; // private by default
    }
 
 4. inline function: (just for function that has few lines of code)
 inline int quas(int x){ return x*x;)
 int main(){ int y=quad(10);}
 //actually it does not create a new box and grab 10, but it replace x to 10:
 // we have: 
 // int main(){
 // int y=10*10;
 //}
 // inline function helps to save memory and program will be faster.
 
 inline funtion in class in 2 ways:
 1.  within the class body, they are inline functions:
 class book{
  void getName(){return name;}
  inline void getAuthor(){return author;}// the keyword inline is optional
 };
 2. under the definition of class in the samw file:
 class book{
 ....};
 void pop(){...} // this is inline function.
 
 HOWEVER:
 it is impossible for incline function in defferent file with class definintion
 for example:
  class definition in file .h, and you add "inline" before any function in file ".cpp" it does not work.
  
 5. Class scope: to access global variable using ::nameVariable
 6. this pointer: this pointer is set to point to the object.
